Here is an example of using Python to perform Bayesian optimization with k-means clustering in parallel:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from skopt import gp_minimize
from skopt.plots import plot_convergence
from skopt.acquisition import gaussian_ei

# Define the k-means clustering objective function
def kmeans_objective(params):
    k, init = params
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=int(k), init=init)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    return -kmeans.inertia_

# Define the search space for k-means hyperparameters
space = [
    (2, 10),  # k
    (0, 1)  # init
]

# Perform Bayesian optimization in parallel
res_gp = gp_minimize(kmeans_objective, space, n_calls=50, random_state=0, n_jobs=-1)

# Plot the convergence of the optimization process
plot_convergence(res_gp)

# Perform k-means clustering with the optimized hyperparameters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=int(res_gp.x[0]), init=res_gp.x[1])
kmeans.fit(X)

# Compute the clustering quality metric (e.g. silhouette score)
silhouette_score = kmeans.silhouette_score()
print("Optimized k-means clustering silhouette score:", silhouette_score)
```
In this example, we define a k-means clustering objective function `kmeans_objective` that takes in a set of hyperparameters `params` and returns the negative inertia of the k-means clustering algorithm. We then define the search space for the k-means hyperparameters `k` and `init` using a list of tuples.

We perform Bayesian optimization in parallel using `gp_minimize` from the `skopt` library, which uses a Gaussian process to model the objective function and performs optimization using the expected improvement acquisition function. We set `n_jobs=-1` to use all available CPU cores for parallelization.

After optimization, we plot the convergence of the optimization process using `plot_convergence`. We then perform k-means clustering with the optimized hyperparameters and compute the clustering quality metric (e.g. silhouette score).

Note that this is a simplified example, and you may want to modify it to suit your specific use case. Additionally, you may want to consider using other acquisition functions or surrogate models depending on your optimization goals.
