The Python packages that implement parallel Bayesian optimization using k-means clustering are:
--
1. **Mango**: Mango is a Python library that uses k-means clustering to horizontally scale Bayesian optimization[1]. It is designed for scalable hyperparameter tuning and is compatible with the scikit-learn API.

2. ~~**ParBayesianOptimization**: This R package (not Python, but mentioned in the search results) allows for parallel Bayesian optimization, including the use of k-means clustering to sample multiple promising points at once[2]~~.

3. ~~**Bayesian-Optimization**: This Python package provides a pure Python implementation of Bayesian global optimization with Gaussian processes, but it does not explicitly mention k-means clustering or parallelization[5]~~.

4. ~~**GPyOpt**: GPyOpt is a Python library that uses Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, but it does not mention k-means clustering or parallelization using k-means[3]~~.

5. **SHERPA**: SHERPA is a Python library that includes implementations of common optimization algorithms, including Bayesian optimization, but it does not mention k-means clustering or parallelization[3].

In summary, Mango is the only Python package mentioned that explicitly uses k-means clustering for parallel Bayesian optimization.

Yes, BoTorch does implement parallel Bayesian optimization. The library provides several features that enable parallelization, including:

1. **Parallel acquisition functions**: BoTorch supports parallel acquisition functions such as qParEGO and qEHVI, which allow for the optimization of multiple candidates in parallel[2].
2. **Batch optimization**: BoTorch allows for batch optimization, where multiple points are evaluated in parallel, which can significantly speed up the optimization process[2][5].
3. **Hardware acceleration**: BoTorch is built on top of PyTorch and leverages its support for parallelization on modern hardware, including GPUs, which can further accelerate the optimization process[4].
4. **Sample average approximation**: BoTorch uses sample average approximation to optimize acquisition functions, which can be parallelized to speed up the optimization process[1][4].

These features enable BoTorch to perform parallel Bayesian optimization, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objectives need to be optimized simultaneously or when the evaluation of the objective function is expensive[2][5].
