The Python packages that implement parallel Bayesian optimization using k-means clustering are:
--
1. **Mango**: Mango is a Python library that uses k-means clustering to horizontally scale Bayesian optimization[1]. It is designed for scalable hyperparameter tuning and is compatible with the scikit-learn API.

2. ~~**ParBayesianOptimization**: This R package (not Python, but mentioned in the search results) allows for parallel Bayesian optimization, including the use of k-means clustering to sample multiple promising points at once[2]~~.

3. ~~**Bayesian-Optimization**: This Python package provides a pure Python implementation of Bayesian global optimization with Gaussian processes, but it does not explicitly mention k-means clustering or parallelization[5]~~.

4. ~~**GPyOpt**: GPyOpt is a Python library that uses Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, but it does not mention k-means clustering or parallelization using k-means[3]~~.

5. **SHERPA**: SHERPA is a Python library that includes implementations of common optimization algorithms, including Bayesian optimization, but it does not mention k-means clustering or parallelization[3].

In summary, Mango is the only Python package mentioned that explicitly uses k-means clustering for parallel Bayesian optimization.

BOTorch parallel opt:

Yes, BoTorch does implement parallel Bayesian optimization. The library provides several features that enable parallelization, including:

1. **Parallel acquisition functions**: BoTorch supports parallel acquisition functions such as qParEGO and qEHVI, which allow for the optimization of multiple candidates in parallel[2].
2. **Batch optimization**: BoTorch allows for batch optimization, where multiple points are evaluated in parallel, which can significantly speed up the optimization process[2][5].
3. **Hardware acceleration**: BoTorch is built on top of PyTorch and leverages its support for parallelization on modern hardware, including GPUs, which can further accelerate the optimization process[4].
4. **Sample average approximation**: BoTorch uses sample average approximation to optimize acquisition functions, which can be parallelized to speed up the optimization process[1][4].

These features enable BoTorch to perform parallel Bayesian optimization, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objectives need to be optimized simultaneously or when the evaluation of the objective function is expensive[2][5].

Here is an example of parallel Bayesian optimization with BoTorch:
```
import torch
from botorch.test_functions.multi_objective import C2DTLZ2
from botorch.models.gp_regression import SingleTaskGP
from botorch.acquisition.monte_carlo import qExpectedHypervolumeImprovement
from botorch.optim import optimize_acqf

# Define the problem
d = 12
M = 2
problem = C2DTLZ2(dim=d, num_objectives=M, negate=True).to(**tkwargs)

# Define the model
model = SingleTaskGP(problem.train_inputs, problem.train_targets, likelihood=HomoskedasticGaussianLikelihood(noise_constraint=Bound(noise_floor=1e-5)))

# Define the acquisition function
qEHVI = qExpectedHypervolumeImprovement(model, problem.ref_point, num_samples=1024)

# Define the batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 4

# Optimize the acquisition function
candidates, _ = optimize_acqf(
    acq_function=qEHVI,
    bounds=problem.bounds,
    q=BATCH_SIZE,
    num_restarts=20,
    raw_samples=1024,
    options={"batch_limit": 5, "maxiter": 200}
)

# Evaluate the candidates
evaluated_candidates = problem.evaluate(candidates)

# Update the model
model.update(candidates, evaluated_candidates)
```
This example uses the `C2DTLZ2` test function, which is a multi-objective problem with two objectives and 12 parameters. The `SingleTaskGP` model is used to model the objectives, and the `qExpectedHypervolumeImprovement` acquisition function is used to select the next batch of candidates to evaluate. The `optimize_acqf` function is used to optimize the acquisition function, and the `evaluate` method is used to evaluate the candidates. Finally, the model is updated with the new data.

Note that this example uses the `qEHVI` acquisition function, which is a parallel acquisition function that can be evaluated in parallel using multiple CPUs or GPUs. This can significantly speed up the optimization process. Additionally, the `optimize_acqf` function can be parallelized using the `num_restarts` argument, which specifies the number of times to restart the optimization process from different initial conditions.

Also, it's worth noting that BoTorch provides other parallel acquisition functions such as `qParEGO` and `qNEHVI` which can be used for parallel Bayesian optimization[1][3][4][5].
