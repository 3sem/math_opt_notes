The Python packages that implement parallel Bayesian optimization using k-means clustering are:
--
1. **Mango**: Mango is a Python library that uses k-means clustering to horizontally scale Bayesian optimization[1]. It is designed for scalable hyperparameter tuning and is compatible with the scikit-learn API.

2. ~~**ParBayesianOptimization**: This R package (not Python, but mentioned in the search results) allows for parallel Bayesian optimization, including the use of k-means clustering to sample multiple promising points at once[2]~~.

3. ~~**Bayesian-Optimization**: This Python package provides a pure Python implementation of Bayesian global optimization with Gaussian processes, but it does not explicitly mention k-means clustering or parallelization[5]~~.

4. **GPyOpt**: GPyOpt is a Python library that uses Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, but it does not mention k-means clustering or parallelization using k-means[3].

5. **SHERPA**: SHERPA is a Python library that includes implementations of common optimization algorithms, including Bayesian optimization, but it does not mention k-means clustering or parallelization[3].

In summary, Mango is the only Python package mentioned that explicitly uses k-means clustering for parallel Bayesian optimization.
